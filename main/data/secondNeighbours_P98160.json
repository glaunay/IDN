coregulator that can have both coactivator and corepressor functions. Adapter protein that forms a transcriptionally active complex with the gamma-secretase-derived amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain.

May act by specifically recognizing and binding histone H2AX phosphorylated on 'Tyr-142' (H2AXY142ph) at double-strand breaks (DSBs), recruiting other pro-apoptosis factors such as MAPK8/JNK1. Required for histone H4 acetylation at double-strand breaks (DSBs). Its ability to specifically bind modified histones and chromatin modifying enzymes such as KAT5/TIP60, probably explains its trancription activation activity.

1: heparan sulfate basal lamina glycoprotein that plays a central role in the formation and the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and directs key events in postsynaptic differentiation. Component of the AGRN-LRP4 receptor complex that induces the phosphorylation and activation of MUSK. The activation of MUSK in myotubes induces the formation of NMJ by regulating different processes including the transcription of specific genes and the clustering of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane. Calcium ions are required for maximal AChR clustering. AGRN function in neurons is highly regulated by alternative splicing, glycan binding and proteolytic processing. Modulates calcium ion homestasis in neurons, specifically by inducing an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions. Functions differentially in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting the alpha(3)-subtype of Na+/K+-ATPase and evoking depolarization at CNS synapses. This secreted isoform forms a bridge, after release from motor neurons, to basal lamina through binding laminin via the NtA domain.Isoform 2: transmembrane form that is the predominate form in neurons of the brain, induces dendritic filopodia and synapse formation in mature hippocampal neurons in large part due to the attached glycosaminoglycan chains and the action of Rho-family GTPases.Isoform 1, isoform 4 and isoform 5: neuron-specific (z+) isoforms that contain C-terminal insertions of 8-19 AA are potent activators of AChR clustering. Isoform 5, agrin (z+8), containing the 8-AA insert, forms a receptor complex in myotubules containing the neuronal AGRN, the muscle-specific kinase MUSK and LRP4, a member of the LDL receptor family. The splicing factors, NOVA1 and NOVA2, regulate AGRN splicing and production of the 'z' isoforms.Isoform 3 and isoform 6: lack any 'z' insert, are muscle-specific and may be involved in endothelial cell differentiation.Agrin N-terminal 110 kDa subunit: is involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth probably due to the presence of the glycosaminoglcan (GAG) side chains of heparan and chondroitin sulfate attached to the Ser/Thr- and Gly/Ser-rich regions. Also involved in modulation of growth factor signaling. (by similarity)Agrin C-terminal 22 kDa fragment: this released fragment is important for agrin signaling and to exert a maximal dendritic filopodia-inducing effect.

AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin. Beta non-catalytic subunit acts as a scaffold on which the AMPK complex assembles, via its C-terminus that bridges alpha (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2) and gamma subunits (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3).","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"5565","locusLink":"5565","gene":"PRKAB2","name":"Hs.50732","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","32933","adrenal gland"],["2","122244","blood"],["6","71614","bone"],["39","1092697","brain"],["4","149070","connective tissue"],["3","16100","ear"],["5","232028","intestine"],["22","205264","liver"],["14","334812","lung"],["7","106367","muscle"],["10","282998","placenta"],["13","435191","testis"]],"Health_State":[["1","12651","adrenal tumor"],["0","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["3","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["2","34477","cervical tumor"],["5","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["21","263212","germ cell tumor"],["6","96618","non neoplasia"],["155","3328738","normal"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["3","69966","embryoid body"],["0","61454","blastocyst"],["54","556961","fetus"],["1","31071","neonate"],["65","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Protein kinase, AMP-activated, beta 2 non-catalytic subunit","cytoband":"1q21.1"},"compartiment":null,"tissue":["embryoid_body","fetus","neonate","juvenile","adult","adrenal_tumor","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adrenal_gland","blood","bone","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","ear","embryonic_tissue","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","placenta","prostate","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":null},"aaNumber":null,"name":"O43741","common":{"Common_Name":["5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit beta-2"],"anyNames":["5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit beta-2","AMPK subunit beta-2"],"Other_Name":["AMPK subunit beta-2"]},"go":null,"pdb":{"data":[{"id":"2F15","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2V8Q","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2V9J","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2V92","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2Y8L","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2Y8Q","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2Y94","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"2YA3","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"4EAI","determinationMethod":"X_ray"},{"id":"4EAJ","determinationMethod":"X_ray"}],"type":"pdbList"},"moreInfo":null,"type":"protein"},{"specie":{"names":["Homo sapiens","Human"],"value":"9606","type":"ncbitaxon"},"status":"active","relationship":null,"molecularWeight":"114709","gene":{"GeneName":"TLL1","ORF_Name":null,"Synonym":"Tll","OrderedLocusName":null},"comments":null,"pfam":{"data":[{"Desc":"CUB domain","id":"PF00431","EntryName":"CUB"},{"Desc":"Astacin (Peptidase family M12A)","id":"PF01400","EntryName":"Astacin"}],"type":"pfamList"},"interpro":{"data":[{"id":"IPR000152","EntryName":"EGF-type aspartate/asparagine hydroxylation site"},{"id":"IPR000742","EntryName":"Epidermal growth factor-like domain"},{"id":"IPR000859","EntryName":"CUB domain"},{"id":"IPR001506","EntryName":"Peptidase M12A, astacin"},{"id":"IPR001881","EntryName":"EGF-like calcium-binding domain"},{"id":"IPR006026","EntryName":"Peptidase, metallopeptidase"},{"id":"IPR013032","EntryName":"EGF-like, conserved site"},{"id":"IPR015446","EntryName":"Bone morphogenetic protein 1/tolloid-like protein"},{"id":"IPR018097","EntryName":"EGF-like calcium-binding, conserved site"},{"id":"IPR024079","EntryName":"Metallopeptidase, catalytic domain"}],"type":"interproList"},"bindingSite":null,"subType":"protein","interactions":null,"stoichiometry":null,"uniprotKW":["KW-0002","KW-0025","KW-0106","KW-0181","KW-0217","KW-0221","KW-0225","KW-0245","KW-0325","KW-0378","KW-0479","KW-0482","KW-0621","KW-0645","KW-0677","KW-0732","KW-0862","KW-0865","KW-0964","KW-0976","KW-1015","KW-1185"],"xref":null,"biofunc":"Protease which processes procollagen C-propeptides, such as chordin, pro-biglycan and pro-lysyl oxidase.

tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a role in many key processes linked to cell growth and survival such as cytoskeleton remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli, cell motility and adhesion, receptor endocytosis, autophagy, DNA damage response and apoptosis. Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 acts also as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"25","locusLink":"25","gene":"ABL1","name":"Hs.431048","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose

Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions. Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibits Notch signaling through interaction with Numb. Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity (By similarity). Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1. Involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1.Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, can reduce Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) to Cu(+) and Fe(2+), respectively. Beta-amyloid 42 is a more effective reductant than beta-amyloid 40. Beta-amyloid peptides bind to lipoproteins and apolipoproteins E and J in the CSF and to HDL particles in plasma, inhibiting metal-catalyzed oxidation of lipoproteins. Beta-APP42 may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicit inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Interaction with Also bind GPC1 in lipid rafts.Appicans elicit adhesion of neural cells to the extracellular matrix and may regulate neurite outgrowth in the brain.

Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation.

Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity).

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.Acts as a receptor for Listeria internalin inlB, mediating entry of the pathogen into cells.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"4233","locusLink":"4233","gene":"MET","name":"Hs.132966","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["16","39833","ascites"],["1","29859","bladder"],["6","71614","bone"],["3","48722","bone marrow"],["2","48477","cervix"],["5","20153","esophagus"],["9","208840","eye"],["29","232028","intestine"],["23","210768","kidney"],["14","205264","liver"],["11","282998","placenta"],["12","210744","skin"],["4","51650","vascular"]],"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["2","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["9","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["23","112562","colorectal tumor"],["5","17244","esophageal tumor"],["22","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["4","263212","germ cell tumor"],["11","133860","head and neck tumor"],["3","68859","kidney tumor"],["12","96015","liver tumor"],["161","3328738","normal"],["6","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["1","69966","embryoid body"],["0","61454","blastocyst"],["56","556961","fetus"],["4","55579","juvenile"],["109","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)","cytoband":"7q31"},"compartiment":["Membrane","Secreted"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","fetus","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","prostate_cancer","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","ascites","bladder","bone","bone_marrow","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","ear","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","ovary","placenta","prostate","salivary_gland","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Expressed in normal hepatocytes as well as in epithelial cells lining the stomach, the small and the large intestine.

as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis. Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions (By similarity). Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibit Notch signaling through interaction with Numb (By similarity). Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity. Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1 (By similarity). May be involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV (By similarity). The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1. (by similarity)Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Binds transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. Rat and mouse beta-amyloid peptides bind only weakly transient metals and have little reducing activity due to substitutions of transient metal chelating residues. Beta-APP42 may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicits inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Also bind GPC1 in lipid rafts.

Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1. Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors. Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1. Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation. Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of ADRBK1, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor. Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase. Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation. Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731'. Enhances DDX58/RIG-I-elicited antiviral signaling. Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376'. Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128'. Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"6714","locusLink":"6714","gene":"SRC","name":"Hs.195659","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","32933","adrenal gland"],["2","39833","ascites"],["4","29859","bladder"],["14","1092697","brain"],["7","212901","embryonic tissue"],["10","232028","intestine"],["5","210768","kidney"],["22","334812","lung"],["3","89729","lymph node"],["9","213419","pancreas"],["12","210744","skin"],["23","435191","testis"]],"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["3","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["7","112562","colorectal tumor"],["9","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["8","263212","germ cell tumor"],["5","107181","glioma"],["59","3328738","normal"],["2","125261","soft tissue muscle tissue tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["4","69966","embryoid body"],["2","61454","blastocyst"],["7","556961","fetus"],["0","31071","neonate"],["1","55579","juvenile"],["53","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"V-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian)","cytoband":"20q12-q13"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Nucleus","Cytoplasm","cytoskeleton"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adrenal_gland","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","brain","embryonic_tissue","eye","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","lymph_node","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","placenta","prostate","skin","stomach","testis","thyroid","trachea","umbilical_cord","uterus"],"comments":"Expressed ubiquitously.

May play an essential role as a negative regulator of embryonic angiogenesis by inhibiting excessive proliferation of endothelial cells. Can promote endothelial cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis in adulthood. Its function in promoting cell proliferation seems to be cell-type specific. Promotes PGF-mediated proliferation of endothelial cells, proliferation of some types of cancer cells, but does not promote proliferation of normal fibroblasts (in vitro). Has very high affinity for VEGFA and relatively low protein kinase activity; may function as a negative regulator of VEGFA signaling by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and preventing its binding to KDR. Likewise, isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2, isoform 3 and isoform 4, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA. Modulates KDR signaling by forming heterodimers with KDR. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol kinase and the downstream signaling pathway. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Phosphorylates SRC and YES1, and may also phosphorylate CBL. Isoform 1 phosphorylates PLCG. Promotes phosphorylation of AKT1 at 'Ser-473'. Promotes phosphorylation of PTK2/FAK1. Isoform 7 has a truncated kinase domain; it increases phosphorylation of SRC at 'Tyr-418' by unknown means and promotes tumor cell invasion.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"2321","locusLink":"2321","gene":"FLT1","name":"Hs.594454","data":{"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["0","32933","adrenal gland"],["1","71614","bone"],["28","1092697","brain"],["10","149070","connective tissue"],["6","212901","embryonic tissue"],["19","208840","eye"],["13","210768","kidney"],["8","334812","lung"],["3","106367","muscle"],["12","213419","pancreas"],["4","20588","parathyroid"],["137","282998","placenta"],["5","189524","prostate"],["22","232076","uterus"]],"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["7","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["2","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["4","263212","germ cell tumor"],["1","107181","glioma"],["5","133860","head and neck tumor"],["308","3328738","normal"],["3","104997","pancreatic tumor"],["6","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["1","69966","embryoid body"],["2","61454","blastocyst"],["32","556961","fetus"],["0","31071","neonate"],["214","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)","cytoband":"13q12"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Endosome","Secreted","Cytoplasm (potential)"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","juvenile","adult","chondrosarcoma","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","liver_tumor","lymphoma","non_neoplasia","normal","pancreatic_tumor","skin_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","blood","bone","brain","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","mammary_gland","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","placenta","prostate","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Detected in normal lung, but also in placenta, liver, kidney, heart and brain tissues.

Plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts, but promotes apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2 and PAK4. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. FGFR2 signaling is down-regulated by ubiquitination, internalization and degradation.

Required for normal down-regulation of the expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, in response to FGF19. Phosphorylates PLCG1 and FRS2. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway.

Required for normal development of the inner ear. Phosphorylates PLCG1, CBL and FRS2. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Plays a role in the regulation of vitamin D metabolism.

kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFC and VEGFD, and plays an essential role in adult lymphangiogenesis and in the development of the vascular network and the cardiovascular system during embryonic development. Promotes proliferation, survival and migration of endothelial cells, and regulates angiogenic sprouting. Signaling by activated FLT4 leads to enhanced production of VEGFC, and to a lesser degree VEGFA, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances FLT4 signaling. Modulates KDR signaling by forming heterodimers. The secreted isoform 3 may function as a decoy receptor for VEGFC and/or VEGFD and play an important role as a negative regulator of VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 or isoform 2 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades; isoform 2 seems to be less efficient in signal transduction, because it has a truncated C-terminus and therefore lacks several phosphorylation sites. Mediates activation of the MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 signaling pathway, of MAPK8 and the JUN signaling pathway, and of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Phosphorylates SHC1. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Promotes phosphorylation of MAPK8 at 'Thr-183' and 'Tyr-185', and of AKT1 at 'Ser-473'.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"2324","locusLink":"2324","gene":"FLT4","name":"Hs.646917","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","32933","adrenal gland"],["3","71614","bone"],["7","1092697","brain"],["2","149070","connective tissue"],["4","208840","eye"],["8","89729","lymph node"],["18","282998","placenta"],["10","435191","testis"]],"Health_State":[["1","12651","adrenal tumor"],["0","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["2","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["6","263212","germ cell tumor"],["4","107181","glioma"],["8","94458","leukemia"],["43","3328738","normal"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["1","69966","embryoid body"],["0","61454","blastocyst"],["13","556961","fetus"],["27","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4","cytoband":"5q35.3"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Nucleus","Secreted"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","fetus","adult","adrenal_tumor","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","chondrosarcoma","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","leukemia","normal","ovarian_tumor","retinoblastoma","adrenal_gland","bone","brain","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","muscle","ovary","placenta","spleen","testis","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Detected in endothelial cells (at protein level).

The phosphorylated STATs dimerize, associate with ISGF3G/IRF-9 to form a complex termed ISGF3 transcription factor, that enters the nucleus. ISGF3 binds to the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) to activate the transcription of interferon stimulated genes, which drive the cell in an antiviral state. In response to type II IFN (IFN-gamma), STAT1 is tyrosine-and serine-phosphorylated. It then forms a homodimer termed IFN-gamma-activated factor (GAF), migrates into the nucleus and binds to the IFN gamma activated sequence (GAS) to drive the expression of the target genes, inducing a cellular antiviral state. Becomes activated in response to KITLG/SCF and KIT signaling. May mediate cellular responses to activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"6772","locusLink":"6772","gene":"STAT1","name":"Hs.642990","data":{"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["3","32933","adrenal

Activates the C-X-C chemokine receptor CXCR4 to induce a rapid and transient rise in the level of intracellular calcium ions and chemotaxis. Also binds to atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3, which activates the beta-arrestin pathway and acts as a scavenger receptor for SDF-1. SDF-1-beta(3-72) and SDF-1-alpha(3-67) show a reduced chemotactic activity. Binding to cell surface proteoglycans seems to inhibit formation of SDF-1-alpha(3-67) and thus to preserve activity on local sites. Acts as a positive regulator of monocyte migration and a negative regulator of monocyte adhesion via the LYN kinase. Stimulates migration of monocytes and T-lymphocytes through its receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, and decreases monocyte adherence to surfaces coated with ICAM-1, a ligand for beta-2 integrins. SDF1A/CXCR4 signaling axis inhibits beta-2 integrin LFA-1 mediated adhesion of monocytes to ICAM-1 through LYN kinase. Inhibits CXCR4-mediated infection by T-cell line-adapted HIV-1. Plays a protective role after myocardial infarction. Induces down-regulation and internalization of ACKR3 expressed in various cells.

Requires primed phosphorylation of the majority of its substrates. In skeletal muscle, contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GYS1 activity and hence glycogen synthesis. May also mediate the development of insulin resistance by regulating activation of transcription factors. Regulates protein synthesis by controlling the activity of initiation factor 2B (EIF2BE/EIF2B5) in the same manner as glycogen synthase. In Wnt signaling, GSK3B forms a multimeric complex with APC, AXIN1 and CTNNB1/beta-catenin and phosphorylates the N-terminus of CTNNB1 leading to its degradation mediated by ubiquitin/proteasomes. Phosphorylates JUN at sites proximal to its DNA-binding domain, thereby reducing its affinity for DNA. Phosphorylates NFATC1/NFATC on conserved serine residues promoting NFATC1/NFATC nuclear export, shutting off NFATC1/NFATC gene regulation, and thereby opposing the action of calcineurin. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU on 'Thr-548', decreasing significantly MAPT/TAU ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. MAPT/TAU is the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease. Plays an important role in ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. Phosphorylates MACF1, inhibiting its binding to microtubules which is critical for its role in bulge stem cell migration and skin wound repair. Probably regulates NF-kappa-B (NFKB1) at the transcriptional level and is required for the NF-kappa-B-mediated anti-apoptotic response to TNF-alpha (TNF/TNFA). Negatively regulates replication in pancreatic beta-cells, resulting in apoptosis, loss of beta-cells and diabetes. Through phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1, may control cell apoptosis in response to growth factors deprivation. Phosphorylates MUC1 in breast cancer cells, decreasing the interaction of MUC1 with CTNNB1/beta-catenin. Is necessary for the establishment of neuronal polarity and axon outgrowth. Phosphorylates MARK2, leading to inhibit its activity. Phosphorylates SIK1 at 'Thr-182', leading to sustain its activity. Phosphorylates ZC3HAV1 which enhances its antiviral activity. Phosphorylates SNAI1, leading to its BTRC-triggered ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylates SFPQ at 'Thr-687' upon T-cell activation. Phosphorylates NR1D1 st 'Ser-55' and 'Ser-59' and stabilizes it by protecting it from proteasomal degradation.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"2932","locusLink":"2932","gene":"GSK3B","name":"Hs.445733","data":{"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["2","39833","ascites"],["1","29859","bladder"],["6","122244","blood"],["23","1092697","brain"],["3","48477","cervix"],["26","149070","connective tissue"],["7","212901","embryonic tissue"],["12","208840","eye"],["10","232028","intestine"],["5","205264","liver"],["11","89729","lymph node"],["4","101480","ovary"],["9","213419","pancreas"],["8","189524","prostate"],["15","210744","skin"],["17","435191","testis"]],"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["3","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["5","112562","colorectal tumor"],["12","263212","germ cell tumor"],["2","107181","glioma"],["7","94458","leukemia"],["126","3328738","normal"],["6","103826","prostate cancer"],["27","125261","soft tissue muscle tissue tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["5","69966","embryoid body"],["2","61454","blastocyst"],["20","556961","fetus"],["1","31071","neonate"],["109","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta","cytoband":"3q13.3"},"compartiment":["Cytoplasm","Nucleus","Cell membrane"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","neonate","infant","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","retinoblastoma","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","pharynx","pituitary_gland","placenta","prostate","skin","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus"],"comments":"Expressed in testis, thymus, prostate and ovary and weakly expressed in lung, brain and kidney.

membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states.

Rac1 p21/rho GDI heterodimer is the active component of the cytosolic factor sigma 1, which is involved in stimulation of the NADPH oxidase activity in macrophages. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. Stimulates PKN2 kinase activity. In concert with RAB7A, plays a role in regulating the formation of RBs (ruffled borders) in osteoclasts. In glioma cells, promotes cell migration and invasion. In podocytes, promotes nuclear shuttling of NR3C2; this modulation is required for a proper kidney functioning. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation.Isoform B has an accelerated GEF-independent GDP/GTP exchange and an impaired GTP hydrolysis, which is restored partially by GTPase-activating proteins.

Under hypoxic conditions, activates the transcription of over 40 genes, including erythropoietin, glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factor, HILPDA, and other genes whose protein products increase oxygen delivery or facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. Plays an essential role in embryonic vascularization, tumor angiogenesis and pathophysiology of ischemic disease. Binds to core DNA sequence 5'-[AG]CGTG-3' within the hypoxia response element (HRE) of target gene promoters. Activation requires recruitment of transcriptional coactivators such as CREBPB and EP300. Activity is enhanced by interaction with both, NCOA1 or NCOA2. Interaction with redox regulatory protein APEX seems to activate CTAD and potentiates activation by NCOA1 and CREBBP. Involved in the axonal distribution and transport of mitochondria in neurons during hypoxia.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"3091","locusLink":"3091","gene":"HIF1A","name":"Hs.597216","data":{"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["7","32933","adrenal gland"],["9","39833","ascites"],["12","29859","bladder"],["22","122244","blood"],["10","48722","bone marrow"],["388","1092697","brain"],["3","48477","cervix"],["53","149070","connective tissue"],["0","16100","ear"],["55","212901","embryonic tissue"],["11","208840","eye"],["1","89524","heart"],["31","232028","intestine"],["37","210768","kidney"],["23","205264","liver"],["17","151237","mammary gland"],["46","66157","mouth"],["6","101480","ovary"],["21","213419","pancreas"],["35","282998","placenta"],["24","189524","prostate"],["43","210744","skin"],["8","53393","spleen"],["134","435191","testis"],["25","79681","thymus"],["93","51782","trachea"],["80","232076","uterus"],["27","51650","vascular"]],"Health_State":[["1","12651","adrenal tumor"],["4","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["14","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["2","34477","cervical tumor"],["10","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["15","112562","colorectal tumor"],["17","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["77","263212","germ cell tumor"],["33","107181","glioma"],["61","133860","head and neck tumor"],["8","68859","kidney tumor"],["18","96015","liver tumor"],["11","102765","lung tumor"],["5","72191","lymphoma"],["21","96618","non neoplasia"],["666","3328738","normal"],["6","76179","ovarian tumor"],["13","103826","prostate cancer"],["31","125261","soft tissue muscle tissue tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["30","69966","embryoid body"],["12","61454","blastocyst"],["90","556961","fetus"],["16","31071","neonate"],["0","23506","infant"],["8","55579","juvenile"],["294","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor)","cytoband":"14q23.2"},"compartiment":["Cytoplasm","Nucleus"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","neonate","juvenile","adult","adrenal_tumor","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","lymphoma","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","retinoblastoma","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","adrenal_gland","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","bone_marrow","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","lymph","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","ovary","pancreas","pharynx","pituitary_gland","placenta","prostate","salivary_gland","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","umbilical_cord","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Expressed in most tissues with highest levels in kidney and heart.
