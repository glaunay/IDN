Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA-and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1.

Also functions in cell adhesion-mediated signaling and implicated in cell polarity.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"1605","locusLink":"1605","gene":"DAG1","name":"Hs.76111","data":{"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["4","32933","adrenal gland"],["3","39833","ascites"],["6","71614","bone"],["1","48722","bone marrow"],["120","1092697","brain"],["10","48477","cervix"],["9","149070","connective tissue"],["36","212901","embryonic tissue"],["16","208840","eye"],["12","89524","heart"],["29","232028","intestine"],["31","210768","kidney"],["8","205264","liver"],["43","334812","lung"],["0","44301","lymph"],["17","151237","mammary gland"],["22","106367","muscle"],["15","101480","ovary"],["24","213419","pancreas"],["55","282998","placenta"],["26","189524","prostate"],["38","210744","skin"],["76","435191","testis"],["19","232076","uterus"]],"Health_State":[["4","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["7","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["0","34477","cervical tumor"],["9","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["15","112562","colorectal tumor"],["2","17244","esophageal tumor"],["14","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["55","263212","germ cell tumor"],["32","107181","glioma"],["8","133860","head and neck tumor"],["11","96618","non neoplasia"],["366","3328738","normal"],["13","76179","ovarian tumor"],["16","104997","pancreatic tumor"],["5","126999","primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the CNS"],["10","103826","prostate cancer"],["6","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["17","69966","embryoid body"],["7","61454","blastocyst"],["61","556961","fetus"],["2","31071","neonate"],["4","23506","infant"],["6","55579","juvenile"],["244","1921915","adult"]]},"title":"Dystroglycan 1 (dystrophin-associated glycoprotein 1)","cytoband":"3p21"},"compartiment":["Secreted","extracellular space","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","cytoskeleton","Nucleus","nucleoplasm","Cell membrane (by similarity)","sarcolemma (by similarity)","Cell junction (by similarity)","synapse (by similarity)","postsynaptic cell membrane (by similarity)"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","neonate","infant","juvenile","adult","adrenal_tumor","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","retinoblastoma","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","adrenal_gland","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","bone_marrow","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","ear","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","pharynx","pituitary_gland","placenta","prostate","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thyroid","trachea","umbilical_cord","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Expressed in a variety of fetal and adult tissues.
