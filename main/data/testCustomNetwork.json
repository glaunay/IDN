Phosphorylates CREB1 and ATF1 in response to mitogenic or stress stimuli such as UV-C irradiation, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and anisomycin. Plays an essential role in the control of RELA transcriptional activity in response to TNF and upon glucocorticoid, associates in the cytoplasm with the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 and contributes to RELA inhibition and repression of inflammatory gene expression. In skeletal myoblasts is required for phosphorylation of RELA at 'Ser-276' during oxidative stress. In erythropoietin-stimulated cells, is necessary for the 'Ser-727' phosphorylation of STAT3 and regulation of its transcriptional potential. Phosphorylates ETV1/ER81 at 'Ser-191' and 'Ser-216', and thereby regulates its ability to stimulate transcription, which may be important during development and breast tumor formation. Directly represses transcription via phosphorylation of 'Ser-1' of histone H2A. Phosphorylates 'Ser-10' of histone H3 in response to mitogenics, stress stimuli and EGF, which results in the transcriptional activation of several immediate early genes, including proto-oncogenes c-fos/FOS and c-jun/JUN. May also phosphorylate 'Ser-28' of histone H3. Mediates the mitogen- and stress-induced phosphorylation of high mobility group protein 1 (HMGN1/HMG14). In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary macrophages, acts downstream of the Toll-like receptor TLR4 to limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functions probably by inducing transcription of the MAP kinase phosphatase DUSP1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL10), via CREB1 and ATF1 transcription factors. Plays a role in neuronal cell death by mediating the downstream effects of excitotoxic injury.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"9252","name":"Hs.510225","gene":"RPS6KA5","locusLink":"9252","title":"Ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90kDa, polypeptide 5","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["5","112562","colorectal tumor"],["7","263212","germ cell tumor"],["2","133860","head and neck tumor"],["4","94458","leukemia"],["72","3328738","normal"],["3","104997","pancreatic tumor"]],"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","29859","bladder"],["5","122244","blood"],["31","1092697","brain"],["2","16100","ear"],["4","208840","eye"],["6","232028","intestine"],["3","213419","pancreas"],["16","282998","placenta"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["0","69966","embryoid body"],["14","556961","fetus"],["35","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"14q31-q32.1"},"compartiment":["Nucleus","Cytoplasm"],"tissue":["fetus","adult","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","colorectal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","leukemia","normal","pancreatic_tumor","prostate_cancer","retinoblastoma","skin_tumor","uterine_tumor","bladder","blood","brain","connective_tissue","ear","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","ovary","pancreas","placenta","prostate","skin","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","tonsil","uterus"],"comments":"Widely expressed with high levels in heart, brain and placenta.

tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family and activating several signaling cascades to convert extracellular cues into appropriate cellular responses. Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules. May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade. Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin.Isoform 2 may act as an antagonist of EGF action.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"1956","name":"Hs.488293","gene":"EGFR","locusLink":"1956","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["2","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["5","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["6","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["4","112562","colorectal tumor"],["1","17244","esophageal tumor"],["11","107181","glioma"],["31","133860","head and neck tumor"],["3","96618","non neoplasia"],["190","3328738","normal"]],"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["0","32933","adrenal gland"],["4","29859","bladder"],["32","1092697","brain"],["3","48477","cervix"],["1","20153","esophagus"],["16","208840","eye"],["7","232028","intestine"],["9","210768","kidney"],["17","334812","lung"],["10","151237","mammary gland"],["23","66157","mouth"],["6","106367","muscle"],["94","282998","placenta"],["5","95793","stomach"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["2","69966","embryoid body"],["1","61454","blastocyst"],["35","556961","fetus"],["0","31071","neonate"],["172","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"7p12"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Endoplasmic reticulum membrane","Golgi apparatus membrane","Nucleus membrane","Endosome","Endosome membrane","Nucleus","Secreted"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","ascites","bladder","bone","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pharynx","placenta","prostate","skin","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Ubiquitously expressed.

Binds to N-sulfated polysaccharide chains on the surface of liver endothelial cells. Inhibits rosette formation. Acts as an adapter protein and is implicated in regulating many processes such as immune complex and pathogen clearance, cell chemotaxis, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrinolysis. Mediates clearance of necrotic cells through enhancing the phagocytosis of necrotic cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent pathway. This process can be regulated by the presence of certain HRG ligands such as heparin and zinc ions. Binds to IgG subclasses of immunoglobins containing kappa and lambda light chains with different affinities regulating their clearance and inhibiting the formation of insoluble immune complexes. Tethers plasminogen to the cell surface. Binds T-cells and alters the cell morphology. Modulates angiogenesis by blocking the CD6-mediated antiangiongenic effect of thrombospondins, THBS1 and THBS2. Acts as a regulator of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway; inhibits endothelial cell motility by reducing VEGF-induced complex formation between PXN/paxillin and ILK/integrin-linked protein kinase and by promoting inhibition of VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinases and alpha-actinins in endothelial cells. Also plays a role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and tumor immune surveillance. Normalizes tumor vessels and promotes antitumor immunity by polarizing tumor-associated macrophages, leading to decreased tumor growth and metastasis.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"3273","name":"Hs.1498","gene":"HRG","locusLink":"3273","title":"Histidine-rich glycoprotein","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["34","96015","liver tumor"],["130","3328738","normal"]],"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","212901","embryonic tissue"],["8","210768","kidney"],["109","205264","liver"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["0","69966","embryoid body"],["37","556961","fetus"],["80","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"3q27"},"compartiment":["Secreted","Secreted"],"tissue":["fetus","adult","liver_tumor","normal","embryonic_tissue","kidney","liver","lung","mammary_gland","thymus"],"comments":"Expressed in macrophages and in malignant cells.

In case of HIV-1 infection, the interaction with extracellular viral Tat protein seems to enhance angiogenesis in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. When associated with alpha-7/beta-1 integrin, regulates cell adhesion and laminin matrix deposition. Involved in promoting endothelial cell motility and angiogenesis. Involved in osteoblast compaction through the fibronectin fibrillogenesis cell-mediated matrix assembly process and the formation of mineralized bone nodules. May be involved in up-regulation of the activity of kinases such as PKC via binding to KRT1. Together with KRT1 and GNB2L1/RACK1, serves as a platform for SRC activation or inactivation.

tyrosine kinase that transduces signals from the extracellular matrix into the cytoplasm by binding to hepatocyte growth factor/HGF ligand. Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.Acts as a receptor for Listeria internalin inlB, mediating entry of the pathogen into cells.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"4233","name":"Hs.132966","gene":"MET","locusLink":"4233","title":"Met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["2","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["9","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["23","112562","colorectal tumor"],["5","17244","esophageal tumor"],["22","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["4","263212","germ cell tumor"],["11","133860","head and neck tumor"],["3","68859","kidney tumor"],["12","96015","liver tumor"],["161","3328738","normal"],["6","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["16","39833","ascites"],["1","29859","bladder"],["6","71614","bone"],["3","48722","bone marrow"],["2","48477","cervix"],["5","20153","esophagus"],["9","208840","eye"],["29","232028","intestine"],["23","210768","kidney"],["14","205264","liver"],["11","282998","placenta"],["12","210744","skin"],["4","51650","vascular"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["1","69966","embryoid body"],["0","61454","blastocyst"],["56","556961","fetus"],["4","55579","juvenile"],["109","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"7q31"},"compartiment":["Membrane","Secreted"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","fetus","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","prostate_cancer","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","ascites","bladder","bone","bone_marrow","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","ear","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","ovary","placenta","prostate","salivary_gland","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Expressed in normal hepatocytes as well as in epithelial cells lining the stomach, the small and the large intestine.

Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity. Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1 (By similarity). May be involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV (By similarity). The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1. (by similarity)Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Binds transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. Rat and mouse beta-amyloid peptides bind only weakly transient metals and have little reducing activity due to substitutions of transient metal chelating residues. Beta-APP42 may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicits inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Also bind GPC1 in lipid rafts.

Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2, GAB1 and SHB. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Promotes phosphorylation of SHC1, STAT1 and PTPN11/SHP2. In the nucleus, enhances RPS6KA1 and CREB1 activity and contributes to the regulation of transcription.

Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1. Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors. Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1. Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation. Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of ADRBK1, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor. Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase. Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation. Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731'. Enhances DDX58/RIG-I-elicited antiviral signaling. Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376'. Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128'. Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"6714","name":"Hs.195659","gene":"SRC","locusLink":"6714","title":"V-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian)","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["3","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["7","112562","colorectal tumor"],["9","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["8","263212","germ cell tumor"],["5","107181","glioma"],["59","3328738","normal"],["2","125261","soft tissue muscle tissue tumor"]],"Body_Sites":[["0","12865","adipose tissue"],["1","32933","adrenal gland"],["2","39833","ascites"],["4","29859","bladder"],["14","1092697","brain"],["7","212901","embryonic tissue"],["10","232028","intestine"],["5","210768","kidney"],["22","334812","lung"],["3","89729","lymph node"],["9","213419","pancreas"],["12","210744","skin"],["23","435191","testis"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["4","69966","embryoid body"],["2","61454","blastocyst"],["7","556961","fetus"],["0","31071","neonate"],["1","55579","juvenile"],["53","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"20q12-q13"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Nucleus","Cytoplasm","cytoskeleton"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","juvenile","adult","bladder_carcinoma","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adrenal_gland","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","brain","embryonic_tissue","eye","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","lymph_node","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","placenta","prostate","skin","stomach","testis","thyroid","trachea","umbilical_cord","uterus"],"comments":"Expressed ubiquitously.

May play an essential role as a negative regulator of embryonic angiogenesis by inhibiting excessive proliferation of endothelial cells. Can promote endothelial cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis in adulthood. Its function in promoting cell proliferation seems to be cell-type specific. Promotes PGF-mediated proliferation of endothelial cells, proliferation of some types of cancer cells, but does not promote proliferation of normal fibroblasts (in vitro). Has very high affinity for VEGFA and relatively low protein kinase activity; may function as a negative regulator of VEGFA signaling by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and preventing its binding to KDR. Likewise, isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2, isoform 3 and isoform 4, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA. Modulates KDR signaling by forming heterodimers with KDR. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol kinase and the downstream signaling pathway. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Phosphorylates SRC and YES1, and may also phosphorylate CBL. Isoform 1 phosphorylates PLCG. Promotes phosphorylation of AKT1 at 'Ser-473'. Promotes phosphorylation of PTK2/FAK1. Isoform 7 has a truncated kinase domain; it increases phosphorylation of SRC at 'Tyr-418' by unknown means and promotes tumor cell invasion.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"2321","name":"Hs.594454","gene":"FLT1","locusLink":"2321","title":"Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)","data":{"Health_State":[["0","12651","adrenal tumor"],["7","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["2","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["4","263212","germ cell tumor"],["1","107181","glioma"],["5","133860","head and neck tumor"],["308","3328738","normal"],["3","104997","pancreatic tumor"],["6","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Body_Sites":[["2","12865","adipose tissue"],["0","32933","adrenal gland"],["1","71614","bone"],["28","1092697","brain"],["10","149070","connective tissue"],["6","212901","embryonic tissue"],["19","208840","eye"],["13","210768","kidney"],["8","334812","lung"],["3","106367","muscle"],["12","213419","pancreas"],["4","20588","parathyroid"],["137","282998","placenta"],["5","189524","prostate"],["22","232076","uterus"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["1","69966","embryoid body"],["2","61454","blastocyst"],["32","556961","fetus"],["0","31071","neonate"],["214","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"13q12"},"compartiment":["Cell membrane","Endosome","Secreted","Cytoplasm (potential)"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","juvenile","adult","chondrosarcoma","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","liver_tumor","lymphoma","non_neoplasia","normal","pancreatic_tumor","skin_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","blood","bone","brain","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","mammary_gland","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","placenta","prostate","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","trachea","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Detected in normal lung, but also in placenta, liver, kidney, heart and brain tissues.

May act as a regulatory node which integrates and coordinates numerous signals leading to an appropriate cellular response. During mitosis, functions as a component of the p53/TP53-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that maintains cyclin-B-CDK1 activity and G2 arrest in response to spindle damage. Also required for p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis, phosphorylating 'Ser-392' of p53/TP53 following UV irradiation. Can also negatively regulate apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspases CASP9 and CASP2 and the apoptotic regulator NOL3. Phosphorylation protects CASP9 from cleavage and activation by CASP8, and inhibits the dimerization of CASP2 and activation of CASP8. Regulates transcription by direct phosphorylation of RNA polymerases I, II, III and IV. Also phosphorylates and regulates numerous transcription factors including NF-kappa-B, STAT1, CREB1, IRF1, IRF2, ATF1, SRF, MAX, JUN, FOS, MYC and MYB. Phosphorylates Hsp90 and its co-chaperones FKBP4 and CDC37, which is essential for chaperone function. Regulates Wnt signaling by phosphorylating CTNNB1 and the transcription factor LEF1. Acts as an ectokinase that phosphorylates several extracellular proteins. During viral infection, phosphorylates various proteins involved in the viral life cycles of EBV, HSV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV and HPV.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"1459","name":"Hs.82201","gene":"CSNK2A2","locusLink":"1459","title":"Casein kinase 2, alpha prime

Plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts, but promotes apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2 and PAK4. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. FGFR2 signaling is down-regulated by ubiquitination, internalization and degradation.

kinase that acts as cell-surface receptor for fibroblast growth factors and plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, and in regulation of lipid metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis, glucose uptake, vitamin D metabolism and phosphate homeostasis. Required for normal down-regulation of the expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, in response to FGF19. Phosphorylates PLCG1 and FRS2. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Promotes SRC-dependent phosphorylation of the matrix protease MMP14 and its lysosomal degradation. FGFR4 signaling is down-regulated by receptor internalization and degradation; MMP14 promotes internalization and degradation of FGFR4.

Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA-and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1.

SDF-1-beta(3-72) and SDF-1-alpha(3-67) show a reduced chemotactic activity. Binding to cell surface proteoglycans seems to inhibit formation of SDF-1-alpha(3-67) and thus to preserve activity on local sites. Acts as a positive regulator of monocyte migration and a negative regulator of monocyte adhesion via the LYN kinase. Stimulates migration of monocytes and T-lymphocytes through its receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, and decreases monocyte adherence to surfaces coated with ICAM-1, a ligand for beta-2 integrins. SDF1A/CXCR4 signaling axis inhibits beta-2 integrin LFA-1 mediated adhesion of monocytes to ICAM-1 through LYN kinase. Inhibits CXCR4-mediated infection by T-cell line-adapted HIV-1.

This may affect gene expression and function in a number of ways that include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by changing sequences involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by changing sequences during viral RNA replication; and RNA structure-dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein-RNA interactions. Can edit both viral and cellular RNAs and can edit RNAs at multiple sites (hyper-editing) or at specific sites (site-specific editing). Its cellular RNA substrates include: bladder cancer-associated protein (BLCAP), neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate (GRIA2) and serotonin (HTR2C) and GABA receptor (GABRA3). Site-specific RNA editing of transcripts encoding these proteins results in amino acid substitutions which consequently alters their functional activities. Exhibits low-level editing at the GRIA2 Q/R site, but edits efficiently at the R/G site and HOTSPOT1. Its viral RNA substrates include: hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus (MV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Exhibits either a proviral (HDV, MV, VSV and HIV-1) or an antiviral effect (HCV) and this can be editing-dependent (HDV and HCV), editing-independent (VSV and MV) or both (HIV-1). Impairs HCV replication via RNA editing at multiple sites. Enhances the replication of MV, VSV and HIV-1 through an editing-independent mechanism via suppression of EIF2AK2/PKR activation and function. Stimulates both the release and infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles by an editing-dependent mechanism where it associates with viral RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5'UTR and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Can enhance viral replication of HDV via A-to-I editing at a site designated as amber/W, thereby changing an UAG amber stop codon to an UIG tryptophan (W) codon that permits synthesis of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg) which has a key role in the assembly of viral particles. However, high levels of ADAR1 inhibit HDV replication.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"103","name":"Hs.12341","gene":"ADAR","locusLink":"103","title":"Adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific","data":{"Health_State":[["3","12651","adrenal tumor"],["1","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["27","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["2","34477","cervical tumor"],["25","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["38","112562","colorectal tumor"],["21","118618","gastrointestinal tumor"],["47","263212","germ cell tumor"],["20","107181","glioma"],["41","133860","head and neck tumor"],["10","68859","kidney tumor"],["17","94458","leukemia"],["37","96015","liver tumor"],["16","72191","lymphoma"],["14","96618","non neoplasia"],["471","3328738","normal"],["6","126999","primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the CNS"],["24","103826","prostate cancer"],["5","46442","retinoblastoma"],["35","90092","uterine tumor"]],"Body_Sites":[["4","12865","adipose tissue"],["7","39833","ascites"],["3","29859","bladder"],["15","122244","blood"],["21","71614","bone"],["139","1092697","brain"],["17","149070","connective tissue"],["1","16100","ear"],["47","212901","embryonic tissue"],["38","208840","eye"],["62","232028","intestine"],["19","210768","kidney"],["2","23492","larynx"],["44","205264","liver"],["65","334812","lung"],["13","44301","lymph"],["34","89729","lymph node"],["35","151237","mammary gland"],["8","106367","muscle"],["5","15535","nerve"],["10","101480","ovary"],["20","213419","pancreas"],["28","282998","placenta"],["31","189524","prostate"],["9","53393","spleen"],["14","95793","stomach"],["37","435191","testis"],["6","79681","thymus"],["70","232076","uterus"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["20","69966","embryoid body"],["16","61454","blastocyst"],["66","556961","fetus"],["4","31071","neonate"],["0","23506","infant"],["383","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"1q21.3"},"compartiment":["Cytoplasm","Nucleus","nucleolus"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","blastocyst","fetus","neonate","juvenile","adult","adrenal_tumor","bladder_carcinoma","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","cervical_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","esophageal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","head_and_neck_tumor","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","lymphoma","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","retinoblastoma","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","adrenal_gland","ascites","bladder","blood","bone","bone_marrow","brain","cervix","connective_tissue","ear","embryonic_tissue","esophagus","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","larynx","liver","lung","lymph","lymph_node","mammary_gland","mouth","muscle","nerve","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","pharynx","pituitary_gland","placenta","prostate","salivary_gland","skin","spleen","stomach","testis","thymus","thyroid","tonsil","trachea","umbilical_cord","uterus","vascular"],"comments":"Ubiquitously expressed, highest levels were found in brain and lung.

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52 and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric p65-p50 and p65-c-Rel complexes are transcriptional activators. The NF-kappa-B p65-p65 complex appears to be involved in invasin-mediated activation of IL-8 expression. The inhibitory effect of I-kappa-B upon NF-kappa-B the cytoplasm is exerted primarily through the interaction with p65. p65 shows a weak DNA-binding site which could contribute directly to DNA binding in the NF-kappa-B complex. Associates with chromatin at the NF-kappa-B promoter region via association with

Acetylates all four core histones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetic tag for transcriptional activation. Mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modification that localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27' (H3K27ac). Also functions as acetyltransferase for nonhistone targets. Acetylates 'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator in the presence of CREBBP. Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase the transcriptional activity of TP53 through acetylation and subsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function. Acetylates HDAC1 leading to its inactivation and modulation of transcription. Acts as a TFAP2A-mediated transcriptional coactivator in presence of CITED2. Plays a role as a coactivator of NEUROD1-dependent transcription of the secretin and p21 genes and controls terminal differentiation of cells in the intestinal epithelium. Promotes cardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediate transcriptional repression. Binds to and may be involved in the transforming capacity of the adenovirus E1A protein. In case of HIV-1 infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat. Regulates Tat's transactivating activity and may help inducing chromatin remodeling of proviral genes. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances its transcriptional activity. Acetylates BCL6 wich disrupts its ability to recruit histone deacetylases and hinders its transcriptional repressor activity.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"2033","name":"Hs.517517","gene":"EP300","locusLink":"2033","title":"E1A binding protein p300","data":{"Health_State":[["1","12651","adrenal

The physical interaction of SPATA18/MIEAP, BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX at the mitochondrial outer membrane regulates the opening of a pore in the mitochondrial double membrane in order to mediate the translocation of lysosomal proteins from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix. Plays an important role in the calprotectin (S100A8/A9)-induced cell death pathway.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"664","name":"Hs.144873","gene":"BNIP3","locusLink":"664","title":"BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting protein 3","data":{"Health_State":[["2","12651","adrenal tumor"],["0","17578","bladder carcinoma"],["1","93094","breast mammary gland tumor"],["10","82837","chondrosarcoma"],["9","107181","glioma"],["5","102765","lung tumor"],["132","3328738","normal"],["7","126999","primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the CNS"]],"Body_Sites":[["1","12865","adipose tissue"],["2","32933","adrenal gland"],["0","39833","ascites"],["3","122244","blood"],["8","71614","bone"],["30","1092697","brain"],["7","212901","embryonic tissue"],["6","208840","eye"],["4","89524","heart"],["15","210768","kidney"],["17","334812","lung"],["10","213419","pancreas"],["5","282998","placenta"],["9","189524","prostate"],["14","435191","testis"]],"Developmental_Stage":[["3","69966","embryoid body"],["0","61454","blastocyst"],["17","556961","fetus"],["1","31071","neonate"],["2","55579","juvenile"],["63","1921915","adult"]]},"cytoband":"10q26.3"},"compartiment":["Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion outer membrane"],"tissue":["embryoid_body","fetus","neonate","juvenile","adult","adrenal_tumor","breast_mammary_gland_tumor","chondrosarcoma","colorectal_tumor","gastrointestinal_tumor","germ_cell_tumor","glioma","kidney_tumor","leukemia","liver_tumor","lung_tumor","lymphoma","non_neoplasia","normal","ovarian_tumor","pancreatic_tumor","primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor_of_the_CNS","prostate_cancer","skin_tumor","soft_tissue_muscle_tissue_tumor","uterine_tumor","adipose_tissue","adrenal_gland","blood","bone","brain","connective_tissue","embryonic_tissue","eye","heart","intestine","kidney","liver","lung","lymph_node","mammary_gland","muscle","ovary","pancreas","parathyroid","placenta","prostate","salivary_gland","skin","stomach","testis","umbilical_cord","uterus","vascular"],"comments":null},"aaNumber":null,"name":"Q12983","glow":false,"py":"816.501664785941","px":"579.315282166465","type":"protein","previousStyleZ":{"fill":"rgb(70, 130, 180)","r":null,"stroke":"rgb(70, 130, 180)","stroke-width":"1"},"fixed":true,"status":"active","relationship":null,"x":"579.233943602097","pfam":{"type":"pfamList","data":[{"id":"PF06553","Desc":"BNIP3","EntryName":"BNIP3"}]},"interpro":{"type":"interproList","data":[{"id":"IPR010548","EntryName":"BNIP3"}]},"bindingSite":null,"cView":"normal","common":{"Common_Name":["BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3"],"anyNames":["BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3"]},"go":null,"index":258,"pdb":{"type":"pdbList","data":[{"id":"2J5D","determinationMethod":"NMR"},{"id":"2KA1","determinationMethod":"NMR"},{"id":"2KA2","determinationMethod":"NMR"}]},"moreInfo":null},{"specie":{"names":["Homo sapiens","Human"],"value":"9606","type":"ncbitaxon"},"linkStore":null,"molecularWeight":"60647","gene":{"GeneName":"PAK1","ORF_Name":null,"Synonym":null,"OrderedLocusName":null},"unBubbleStyle":{},"comments":null,"y":"778.930649440182","previousStyle":{"r":"8","stroke":"rgb(70, 130, 180)","stroke-width":"1"},"manualHide":false,"pView":"normal","stoichiometry":null,"interactions":null,"subType":"protein","weight":1,"uniprotKW":["KW-0002","KW-0007","KW-0021","KW-0025","KW-0053","KW-0067","KW-0181","KW-0268","KW-0418","KW-0472","KW-0547","KW-0597","KW-0621","KW-0723","KW-0808","KW-0963","KW-0965","KW-1003","KW-1185"],"central":false,"xref":null,"biofunc":"Protein kinase involved in intracellular signaling pathways downstream of integrins and receptor-type kinases that plays an important role in cytoskeleton dynamics, in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, mitosis, and in vesicle-mediated transport processes. Can directly phosphorylate BAD and protects cells against apoptosis. Activated by interaction with CDC42 and RAC1. Functions as GTPase effector that links the Rho-related GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 to the JNK MAP kinase pathway. Phosphorylates and activates MAP2K1, and thereby mediates activation of downstream MAP kinases. Involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, actin stress fibers and of focal adhesion complexes. Phosphorylates the tubulin chaperone TBCB and thereby plays a role in the regulation of microtubule biogenesis and organization of the tubulin cytoskeleton. Plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels. Part of a ternary complex that contains PAK1, DVL1 and MUSK that is important for MUSK-dependent regulation of AChR clustering during the formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Activity is inhibited in cells undergoing apoptosis, potentially due to binding of CDC2L1 and CDC2L2. Phosphorylates MYL9/MLC2. Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-338' and 'Ser-339' resulting in: activation of RAF1, stimulation of RAF1 translocation to mitochondria, phosphorylation of BAD by RAF1, and RAF1 binding to BCL2. Phosphorylates SNAI1 at 'Ser-246' promoting its transcriptional repressor activity by increasing its accumulation in the nucleus. In podocytes, promotes NR3C2 nuclear localization. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced phosphorylation of LIMK1 and cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation.","location":{"expressionLevels":{"geneId":"5058","name":"Hs.435714","gene":"PAK1","locusLink":"5058","title":"P21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase
